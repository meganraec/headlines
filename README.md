# Headlines

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/headlines`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

This gem is a tool for collecting the latest CRE news headlines and details, as well as article abstracts and links, to create an HTML newsletter. Users can drill further to read full articles as found online. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'headlines'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install headlines

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
